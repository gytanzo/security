Checklist start
        - Follow the flowchart in Documentation.pdf, it summarizes the logic this program should take pretty well
        - Make sure to store the previous number and count repeats, this will make programming the password reset easier
        - Recall that there are two reserved passwords: 9407 and 0000
        - Try not to make the code too ugly
        Checklist end
        - Expected start date (on the programming portion): 10/10, if not that then the 16th
        - Currently working on documentation, so I can't exactly start this part yet
